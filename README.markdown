## GNU Smalltalk Koans

Hey there and welcome!

All koan files contain a set of tests, each starting with 'test'.  Solve each test one by one, running `script/run` in between.

### GNU Smalltalk Syntax and Notation Conventions

`| variable1 variable2 |` is to declare variable1 and variable2 separate by a space.  At least one space must be used to separate variables.  Commas are not used.

`:=` is an assignment operator

`"this is a comment"`

`'this is a string'`

`#speak` is the notation used to describe the message 'speak'.

Ok, have at it!

### Running koans (only on Mac OS X, for now)

In the root directory, type:

`script/run`
